Greetings,

Welcome to my version of Calculator.

Facts on the version from 28/03/2023 :
- numbers and signs can be input from keyboard or using mouse to click on the buttons that appear on the screen;
- only 2 number operations can be performed
- the result from a previous operation is not used as first number for the succeding operation; hence, first number must be input by user.

Best regards.
